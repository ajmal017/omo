0.17.0 Changes

* New `inlineCss` and `inlineScript` methods were added to the
  AssetCompressHelper. These new methods allow you to inline js/css
  on the page. Note that the assets will be rebuilt on each page request.

See [github releases](https://github.com/markstory/asset_compress/releases)
for changelogs on previous releases.
